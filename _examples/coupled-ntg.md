In this example the experimental data of constant current discharge of leaf cells are provided within in the directory. The processed experimental discharge data under various C Rates are normalized against time. The cell potentials are plotted against the current density coordinates, the intercepts of these curves at zero current density represent the values of open circuit potential and the slopes represent the reciprocal of the cell polarization parameter. These discrete data points can be curve fitted to a polynomial expression accurately parametrize the NTG model.
