In this example, processed experimental discharge data under various C-rates are normalized against time and cell potentials are plotted against the current density coordinates. Intercepts of these curves at zero current density represent the values of open circuit potential and the slopes represent the reciprocal of the cell polarization parameter. These discrete data points can be curve fitted to a polynomial expression to accurately parameterize the NTG model.
